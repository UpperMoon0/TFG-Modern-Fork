# NsTut TFG fork

This branch is the source of truth for NsTut changes layered on top of the released TerraFirmaGreg Modern pack.

## Branch model

The fork uses three deliberately different branch roles:

- `dev` is the integration/development branch. Upstream TFG development and NsTut feature work land here first. It is never a deployment pointer.
- `nstut/<base>` is a release-construction branch, for example `nstut/0.13.10`. It starts from the currently promoted release history, receives only the reviewed pack changes intended for that release, regenerates deployment metadata, and is fully validated before promotion.
- `nstut/stable` is a production promotion pointer. Modpack Manager follows only this branch. Do not develop on it and do not merge `dev` into it directly.

`nstut/release.json` records the upstream base, release-construction branch, overlay version, and immutable deployment tag.

### Promotion procedure

1. Integrate and test changes on `dev`.
2. Bring the reviewed release content into the matching `nstut/<base>` construction branch.
3. Bump `overlayVersion` and `sourceRef` in `nstut/release.json`.
4. Regenerate `nstut/modpack-manager.patch.json` and run the NsTut validators.
5. Commit the complete release state.
6. Create the immutable `sourceRef` tag on that exact release commit and push it.
7. Open a PR from the declared `nstut/<base>` branch to `nstut/stable`.
8. Merge only after both `validate` and `promotion-gate` pass.

The promotion gate rejects a PR into `nstut/stable` when its source is not the declared release-construction branch, when the immutable tag is missing, when the tag does not point to the exact PR head, or when the release branch does not descend from the current stable release.

On `nstut/stable`, validation additionally requires the complete repository tree to match the immutable deployment tag. This catches accidental direct `dev -> stable` merges even if `release.json` itself was not modified.

## What lives natively in the fork

Pack-owned changes are ordinary tracked files and Pakku metadata. This currently includes the CE Horse Power dependency/config, custom managed mods, the GTCEu weather/terrain explosion setting, and server-export FTB chunk limits.

GitHub projects with multiple loader assets are pinned to the reviewed Forge 1.20.1 asset and use update_strategy NONE; version changes are explicit fork commits rather than implicit Pakku updates.

## Deployment metadata

nstut/managed-mods.json contains exact downloadable artifacts and cleanup rules.

nstut/runtime-overlays.json describes semantic overlays for mutable config/runtime files. YAML, TOML, and SNBT entries are emitted into nstut/modpack-manager.patch.json. Existing-world FTB SNBT is patched semantically through patchSnbt; nstut/tools/patch-existing-server.py remains a standalone fallback that updates the same managed keys.

nstut/tools/generate-modpack-manager-manifest.py also inspects the fork diff against baseRef. Any future ordinary changed file not classified as mutable or metadata is emitted as an exact file replacement, sourced from the immutable sourceRef tag.

## Validation

Run these commands from the repository root:

    python nstut/tools/generate-modpack-manager-manifest.py
    python nstut/tools/validate.py

The validator checks the upstream ancestry, Forge/Minecraft target, exact managed JAR filenames/hashes, client-only boundaries, native config policy, server FTB defaults, and generated manifest freshness.

`nstut/stable` is therefore intentionally boring: it exists to identify the latest approved immutable release, not to accumulate development commits. Pakku server-overrides and client-overrides are generated to their real installation path and target, never copied under `.pakku`.

## Overlay 0.13.10-nstut.29

All 11 managed mods were checked against compatible stable Forge 1.20.1 releases on 2026-10-04. Economy is updated to 0.0.16 and Celestial Nail to 0.1.5; the other nine managed mods are current. The two updated JARs were downloaded and their SHA-256 hashes verified against GitHub release asset digests. Celestial Nail 0.1.5 requires Perfomant Boom 1.1.3 or newer within 1.x, satisfied by the current pin.

Economy Tank capacity is 512 buckets (`tankCapacity=512000`, in mB) in `config/economy-storage.properties`. Fresh client/server exports include this config. Modpack Manager and the existing-server fallback patch only this key, preserving other storage settings such as `allowExternalAutomation`. Economy 0.0.16 upgrades already-placed tanks when they load on the server; stored fluid and larger saved capacities are preserved. Restart the game or server after applying the update. Modpack Manager 1.0.6 already supports the generated property patch; no app rebuild is required.

Server exports and existing-server overlays set `online-mode=false`. Only that property is managed; existing world names, ports, MOTDs, and other properties remain intact. Simply Speakers uploads are limited to 100 MiB (`maxUploadSize=104857600`) on clients, singleplayer, and servers. The server keeps its existing 512-block speaker range.

TrueUUID 1.3.0 for Forge 1.20.1 is required on both clients and servers. Premium players must join with their Microsoft/Mojang session so TrueUUID verifies their account and retains their original UUID. Existing inventories, advancements, statistics, mod capabilities, teams, quests, claims, balances, and entity ownership continue to refer to that identity; do not rename premium saves to offline UUIDs. Players without TrueUUID are refused before entering the world.

The server policy permits explicit offline sessions only for names that are not already bound to a verified account. Failed premium checks and timeouts must not downgrade to an offline profile. When converting an existing server, stop joins, back up identity data, and seed `config/trueuuid-registry.json` from confirmed premium identities before reopening joins. This registry belongs to the individual server and must never be shipped as a pack override. Keep `knownPremiumDenyOffline` and `allowOfflineForUnknownOnly` enabled. Account renames keep the verified UUID; newly changed names should also be bound in the server registry before admitting offline sessions with those names.

Upstream installation and authentication details: https://github.com/YuWan-030/TrueUUID/tree/v1.3.0.

With the server and wake service stopped, preview `python3 nstut/tools/prepare-premium-identities.py <server-root>`, then repeat with `--apply` to reserve cached premium names that have existing v4 UUID saves. The tool reads Java world-name syntax, preserves existing bindings, refuses conflicting UUIDs or malformed registries, ignores offline IDs and cache entries without saves, and changes only the server-private TrueUUID registry. It refuses to proceed if any saved premium UUID has no reserved name; restore its username cache or confirm and bind that identity first. Back up the world and identity files before changing login policy. A real premium-client join is still required to verify the complete login and gameplay path.

Merge the pack changes through the release-construction branch, tag its final reviewed commit as `nstut-0.13.10.29`, and promote it through the existing stable gate.
